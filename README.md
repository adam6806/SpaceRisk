SpaceRisk
=========

A space themed version of risk in the turn style of words with friends.

This project is the result of a desire to increase my own knowledge of technologies I use at work. My experience has been that the best way to learn something is to build it from the ground up. Coming in to a pre-existing project can be quite difficult.

Technologies this project will employ:

  * PostgreSQL database
  * Wildfly application server
  * Java 8
  * Angular JS
  * Netbeans IDE
  * Maven
  * Github
  
If you own Risk or Words With Friends please don't sue me :)
